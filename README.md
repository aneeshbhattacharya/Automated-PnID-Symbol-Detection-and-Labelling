# Automated-PnID-Symbol-Detection-and-Labelling 
## We have developed a system for detecting and labelling various P&ID symbols. <br>
The system is designed to: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Take a raw P&ID diagram sheet as input</li>
<li>Output the following:
  <ul>
    <li>A JPG image with bounding boxes drawn around each detected symbol with their object ID</li>
    <li>A PDF file containing the object ID, class ID, Component Name, Item Label and bounding box regions </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
